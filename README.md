# DSP_Fine_Image_Classification
We propose explainability and feature importance to further advance Right Whale fine-grained image classification using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Our framework builds upon a ResNet model, with XAI approaches such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GRAD CAM), and Saliency Maps.
